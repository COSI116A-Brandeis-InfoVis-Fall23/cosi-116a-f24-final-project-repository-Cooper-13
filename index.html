    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>Initially, we were motivated to understand the scope and scale of government financial waste. 
      During our initial research, we came across public-facing examples of government spending that 
      we considered wasteful (i.e; <a href="https://www.farmlinkproject.org/stories-and-features/cheese-caves-and-food-surpluses-why-the-u-s-government-currently-stores-1-4-billion-lbs-of-cheese">government cheese caves</a>), and wanted to dig deeper into the anatomy 
      of government spending nationwide. To provide a basis for interesting analysis, we chose to break 
      spending down in two major ways: by state and by department. After exploring available resources, 
      we found that the Department of Defense is, in nearly every U.S. state, one of the top spenders. 
      Given that the Department of Defense is often responsible for a significant portion of budgetary 
      waste (i.e; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html">leaving equipment behind after operations</a>), we chose to focus our visualization on 
      how much spending the Department of Defense is responsible for by state. Our data provides 
      interesting insights into the spending priorities of the U.S. government, and should spark 
      meaningful discussions about the massive military spending that has become routine in America. 
      By showing the dollar amount spent by the military, and the percentage of a state’s total 
      spending that takes up, we aim to provide a complete picture of the Department of Defense’s 
      impact on the U.S.’s budget.<br><br>
      </p><p>
      Motivating questions:
      <p>1. Where does the U.S. government spend the majority of its money?</p>
      <p>2. How does military spending compare to other major categories of spending?</p>
      <p>3. How does this comparison vary across states?</p>
      </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>To be done after visualization is complete.</p>

    <br>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>Our data comes from the U.S. government’s public repository of state-level spending data, 
      at <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/state">https://www.usaspending.gov/state</a>. 
      For each state, we filtered the data to be from January 1st, 2023 to December 31st, 2023. 
      Some states still had too many records to download, so we filtered the data to
      only include transactions over $250. We feel that both of these filters 
      ensure that our data is a representative sample of government spending over the course, 
      addressing data availability concerns without compromising on data validity. Once the 
      data was downloaded, we extracted the total outlayed amount for the Department of Defense 
      and the other three departments that spent the most in that state. This allowed us to create 
      a representative sample of the state’s total spending, as there was typically a large drop 
      off after the first few highest-spending departments. This process was repeated for each state, 
      and provided us with all the data we would need to complete our visualization. We put the total 
      outlayed amount for each state into Tableau to create the bar graphs necessary for our tooltips, 
      used the DoD’s spending to color in our heatmap, and used all of the data to create our table.
      <br><br>We chose not to include the spending data for every department that operated within each state. 
      By narrowing our focus to only the Department of Defense and the other top three departments, 
      we feel that we created a more easily understood (but still insightful) visualization.
      </p>

      <br>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>Our task table holds three tasks. By order of importance, the first task is to understand 
      how much money the government wastes per category. To categorize the government’s waste, we 
      broke spending down by department on a state level. We feel that, wherever the most spending 
      is within a state, the most waste also likely resides. So, in order to make insights into how 
      much money is being wasted by different government departments, we must first understand how 
      much they’re actually spending. This task’s key goals are to compare, lookup, and present 
      data. The second most important task is seeing categories of government spending. This is 
      completed during the pursuit of the aforementioned goal. To understand government waste, 
      we must first understand government spending. The goals of this task are to summarize, 
      explore, and discover data. Our third most important goal is to see what problems the 
      wasted money could address. This is addressed in our conclusion. The goal of this task is 
      to identify, browse, and discover the data. <br><br>While the first two tasks are essential to the 
      visualization itself, the third task is especially important to its interpretation. By 
      gaining an understanding of what the U.S. government could alternatively spend its budget 
      on, the spending choices it currently makes take on new meanings.
      </p>

      <br>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p>For our final visualization, the heat map is central. The more red a state is, the 
      higher the amount the Department of Defense spent in that state. We’ll have two view 
      present: one that shows the dollar amount spent by the Department of Defense in that 
      state, and one showing the percentage of total spending within the state that is 
      attributed to the Department of Defense. Combined, these will provide an accurate 
      picture of the Department’s spending nationwide. We’re using the color red to emphasize 
      the violent nature of many Department of Defense operations, and the gravity of the amount that they are spending.
      When a state is moused over, a tooltip will pop up, containing a blue bar graph 
      showing more information about the spending within the state. The corresponding 
      row in the table will also light up in blue. We chose to use blue to contrast with 
      the red of the heat map, drawing attention to the small details that we’re making available.
      <br><br>More information (and photos of sketches) will be added in to this section as progress continues on our visualization.
