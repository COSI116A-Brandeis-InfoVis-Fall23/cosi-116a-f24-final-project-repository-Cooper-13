    <h1>Project Team 5: U.S. DoD Spending, COSI 116A F24</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Cooper Gottfried</strong>, <strong>Dean Carey</strong>, <strong>Adam Rieden</strong>, <strong>Garret Rieden</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>Initially, we were motivated to understand the scope and scale of 
      government financial waste. During our initial research, we came 
      across public-facing examples of government spending that we considered 
      wasteful (i.e; <a href="https://www.farmlinkproject.org/stories-and-features/cheese-caves-and-food-surpluses-why-the-u-s-government-currently-stores-1-4-billion-lbs-of-cheese">government cheese caves</a>), and wanted to dig deeper into 
      the anatomy of federal government spending nationwide. To provide a basis 
      for interesting analysis, we chose to break spending down in two major ways: 
      by state and by department. After exploring available resources, we found that 
      the Department of Defense (DoD) is, in nearly every U.S. state, one of the top 
      spenders. Given that the Department of Defense is often responsible for a 
      significant portion of budgetary waste (i.e; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html">leaving equipment behind after operations</a>)
      , we chose to focus our visualization on how much spending the 
      Department of Defense is responsible for by state. Our data provides interesting 
      insights into the spending priorities of the U.S. government, and we hope it will 
      spark meaningful discussions about the massive military spending that has become 
      routine in America. By showing the amount spent by the DoD, and the percentage of 
      federal spending that was related to the DoD by state, we aim to provide a complete 
      picture of the military’s financial impact on the U.S..<br><br>
      </p><p>
      Motivating questions:
      <p>1. Where does the U.S. government spend the majority of its money?</p>
      <p>2. How does military spending compare to other major categories of spending?</p>
      <p>3. How does this comparison vary across states?</p>
      </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>There’s a few different components of our UI we’d like to talk about. First is the 
      brushing/linking between the table and the map. When an element is selected on one 
      of these, it becomes selected on the other. This is to provide more detailed 
      information, organized in a different fashion, about each state. It also allows 
      users to understand what the colors on this map actually mean. The legend on our 
      map also aids users in understanding what they’re looking at.
      <br><br>
      Users may also use the “toggle colors” button to switch between a view of states 
      organized by DoD% of state budget (red) and the state’s DoD spending as a % of national 
      DoD spending (gold). We find that these are both interesting data points to consider, 
      so we wanted to give our users the opportunity to swap fluidly between them.
      <br><br>
      Finally, we also have a popup that appears when users mouse over a state, a bar 
      graph that appears between the map and the table. This bar graph shows more information 
      about the federal government departments that spend the most in each state (details on demand). 
      The red “mode” on the map already shows what percentage of in-state spending is from the DoD, 
      but this shows users what other federal departments are big spenders within the state. We find 
      this to be particularly interesting in states with low percentages of DoD spending, because the 
      other dominant departments can be seen.
      </p>

    <br>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>Our data comes from the U.S. government’s public repository of state-level spending data, 
      at <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/state">this link</a>. 
      For each state, we filtered the data to be from January 1st, 2023 to December 31st, 2023. 
      Some states still had too many records to download, so we filtered the data to
      only include transactions over $250. We feel that both of these filters 
      ensure that our data is a representative sample of government spending over the course of a year, 
      addressing data availability concerns well without compromising on data validity. 
      <br><br>
      Once the data was downloaded, we extracted the total outlayed amount for the Department of Defense 
      and the other three departments that spent the most in that state. This allowed us to create 
      a representative sample of the state’s total spending, as there was typically a large drop 
      off after the first few highest-spending departments. This process was repeated for each state, 
      and provided us with all the data we would need to complete our visualization. We put the total 
      outlayed amount for each state into Tableau to create the bar graphs necessary for our side box graph pop-up, 
      used the DoD’s spending to color in our heatmap, and used all of the data to create our table.
      <br><br>
      We chose not to include the spending data for every department that operated within each state. 
      By narrowing our focus to only the Department of Defense and the other top three departments, 
      we feel that we created a more easily understood (but still insightful) visualization.
      </p>

      <br>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>Our task table holds three tasks. By order of importance, the first task is to understand 
      how much money the government wastes per category. To categorize the government’s waste, we 
      broke spending down by department on a state level. We feel that, wherever the most spending 
      is within a state, the most waste also likely resides. So, in order to make insights into how 
      much money is being wasted by different government departments, we must first understand how 
      much they’re actually spending. This task’s key goals are to compare, lookup, and present 
      data. The second most important task is seeing categories of government spending. This is 
      completed during the pursuit of the aforementioned goal. To understand government waste, 
      we must first understand government spending. The goals of this task are to summarize, 
      explore, and discover data. Our third most important goal is to see what problems the 
      wasted money could address. This is addressed in our conclusion. The goal of this task is 
      to identify, browse, and discover the data. 
      <br><br>
      While the first two tasks are essential to the visualization itself, the third 
      task is especially important to its interpretation. By gaining an understanding of 
      what the U.S. government could alternatively spend its budget 
      on, the spending choices it currently makes take on new meanings.
      </p>

      <br>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p>For our final visualization, the heat map is central. The more red a state is, the 
      higher the amount the Department of Defense spent in that state. We’ll have two view 
      present: one that shows the dollar amount spent by the Department of Defense in that 
      state, and one showing the percentage of total spending within the state that is 
      attributed to the Department of Defense. Combined, these will provide an accurate 
      picture of the Department’s spending nationwide. We’re using the color red to emphasize 
      the violent nature of many Department of Defense operations, and the gravity of the amount that they are spending.
      When a state is moused over, a side box will pop up, containing a blue bar graph 
      showing more information about the spending within the state. The corresponding 
      row in the table will also light up in blue. We chose to use blue to contrast with 
      the red of the heat map, drawing attention to the small details that we’re making available.
      <br><br>
      We've also added a second heat map, the gold one that can be seen when colors are toggled, to show the
      percentage of the DoD's total, national spending that happened in each state. We iterated on the colors, and the 
      transitions between them many times. We eventually settled on gold, because it's distinct enough from the red scale.
      that we used so that users will not mix up our two maps. We also chose to use blue as the color for our highlights (both
      on the table and on the map), because it's distinct from both the red and the gold.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>Overall, we’re quite happy with how this project went. There were some difficulties with the heatmap, and 
      with overall formatting on the website, but we worked out the problems as we went on. We’re pleased with 
      the results we were able to show, happy about the overall quality of our visualization, and satisfied with 
      our work this semester. We feel that we accurately portrayed DoD spending, and showed the sheer scale of it on 
      a national level. While this has been done before, we feel that breaking it down by state was a somewhat novel approach.
      <br><br>
      We do, however, acknowledge that there’s certainly more to be done. In an ideal world, we would have been 
      able to investigate individual DoD contractors and possibly even display data on a county level instead of 
      a state level. By investigating individual DoD contractors, we think we would have found interesting patterns 
      about U.S. government spending, waste, and maybe even corruption. By breaking data down to the county level, 
      we may have been able to show even more interesting nationwide patterns. Still, though, we feel that 
      this visualization showcases our abilities, and our findings, quite well.
      <br><br>
      For future work, we would love to summarize what problems DoD spending could otherwise address. 
      Overall, the DoD spent $1,325,974,585,251 in 2023. That is a shockingly high amount of money, and 
      it could be used to provide universal healthcare, solve homelessness, or otherwise address any 
      number of national problems. This is an ongoing, and well-publicized, topic that could be a full research project on its own.
